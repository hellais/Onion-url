These are the notes I am keeping to develop pet.py, the pet name generator.

- knuth_words
  The word list I am using.

- top-gt4.txt
  The first three characters of at least 4 words in knuth_words

- read.py
  The script used to generate top-gt4.txt

- *.py
  Some broken experiments. Please do not look at them (you would
  be wasting your (precious?) time.
